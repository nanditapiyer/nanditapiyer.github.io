			<h2>Coursework</h2>
			<p class = "about_me">
			<b>CS188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp Currently enrolled. Basic ideas and techniques underlying the design of intelligent computer systems. Topics include heuristic search, problem solving, game playing, knowledge representation, logical inference, planning, reasoning under uncertainty, expert systems, learning, perception, robotics, language understanding.<br>
			<b>CS170: Algorithms</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp 
				Currently enrolled. Concept and basic techniques in the design and analysis of algorithms; models of computation; lower bounds; algorithms for optimum search trees, balanced trees and UNION-FIND algorithms; numerical and algebraic algorithms; combinatorial algorithms. Turing machines, how to count steps, deterministic and nondeterministic Turing machines, NP-completeness. Unsolvable and intractable problems. 

			<br>
			<b>CS161: Computer Security</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp 
				Currently enrolled. Introduction to computer security. Cryptography, including encryption, authentication, hash functions, cryptographic protocols, and applications. Operating system security, access control. Network security, firewalls, viruses, and worms. Software security, defensive programming, and language-based security. Case studies from real-world systems. 

			<br>
			<b>CS70: Discrete Math and Probability Theory </b><br>&nbsp&nbsp
				Logic, infinity, and induction; applications include undecidability and stable marriage problem. Modular arithmetic and GCDs; applications include primality testing and cryptography. Polynomials; examples include error correcting codes and interpolation. Probability including sample spaces, independence, random variables, law of large numbers; examples include load balancing
			 <br>
			<b>CS61C: Computer Architecture</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp
				The internal organization and operation of digital computers. Machine architecture, support for high-level languages (logic, arithmetic, instruction sequencing) and operating systems (I/O, interrupts, memory management, process switching). Elements of computer logic design. Tradeoffs involved in fundamental architectural design decisions. 
			 <br>
			<b>DES INV 22: Prototyping and Fabrication</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp 
				This course teaches concepts, skills and methods required to design, prototype, and fabricate
physical objects. Each week relevant techniques in 2D and 3D modeling and fabrication are
presented along with basic electronics and circuit design. Projects are assigned that cover the
weekly course material. Topics include a range of prototyping and fabrication techniques
including laserÂ­cutting, 3D modeling and 3D printing, soldering, basic circuits, microcontrollers
(Arduino), sensors and actuators, and interface mockups.

			<br>
			<b>CS61B: Data Structures</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp 
				Fundamental dynamic data structures, including linear lists, queues, trees, and other linked structures; arrays strings, and hash tables. Storage management. Elementary principles of software engineering. Abstract data types. Algorithms for sorting and searching. Introduction to the Java programming language. 
			<br>
			<b>CS 61A: Functional Programming, data abstraction, object-oriented programming</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp
				Introduction to programming and computer science. This course exposes students to techniques of abstraction at several levels: (a) within a programming language, using higher-order functions, manifest types, data-directed programming, and message-passing; (b) between programming languages, using functional and rule-based languages as examples. It also relates these techniques to the practical problems of implementation of languages and algorithms on a von Neumann machine.
			
			<br>
			<b>EE16A: Designing Information Devices and Systems I</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp 
				Fundamentals of designing modern information devices and systems that interface with the real world. Together, this course sequence provides a comprehensive foundation for core EECS topics in signal processing, learning, control, and circuit design while introducing key linear-algebraic concepts motivated by application contexts. 

			<br>
			<b>Math 54: Linear algebra and differential equations</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp Theoretical linear algebra class.<br>
			<b>AP Computer Science</b><br>&nbsp&nbsp Data structures, UI, game development, Java.<br> </p>
